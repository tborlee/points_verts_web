## Environment Variables

For the Mapbox integration to work, you need to define several environment variables during dev/build:

- `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`: Mapbox access token
- `VITE_MAPBOX_USERNAME`: your mapbox username
- `VITE_MAPBOX_LIGHT_STYLE`: id of the light style
- `VITE_MAPBOX_DARK_STYLE`: id of the dark style

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
